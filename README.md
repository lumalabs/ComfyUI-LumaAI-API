This is a custom node for ComfyUI that allows you to use the Luma AI API directly in ComfyUI. Luma AI API is based on top of [Dream Machine](https://lumalabs.ai/dream-machine/api), which is a complete suite of models for image and video generation. For more information, see [Luma AI API Documentation](https://docs.lumalabs.ai/docs/api).

## Requirements

Before using this node, you need to have an LumaAI API key. Get one [here](https://lumalabs.ai/dream-machine/api). If you want to use images as input, you will need to host them. As a suggestion, you can use [ImgBB](https://api.imgbb.com/) to host your images.

## Installation

### Installing manually

1. Navigate to the `ComfyUI/custom_nodes` directory.

2. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/lumalabs/ComfyUI-LumaAI-API.git
   ```
   The path should be `ComfyUI/custom_nodes/ComfyUI-LumaAI-API/*`, where `*` represents all the files in this repo.
  
3. Install the dependencies:

  - If you are using Windows (ComfyUI portable) run: `.\python_embeded\python.exe -m pip install -r ComfyUI\custom_nodes\ComfyUI-LumaAI-API\requirements.txt`
  - If you are using Linux or MacOS, run: `cd ComfyUI-LumaAI-API && pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the dependencies.

4. If you don't want to expose your Luma API key, you can add it to the `config.ini` file and keep it empty in the node.

5. Start ComfyUI and enjoy using the LumaAI API node!

### Installing with ComfyUI-Manager

1. Open ComfyUI-Manager and install the LumaAI API node (ComfyUI-LumaAI-API).

### Installing with Comfy Registry

1. Run `comfy node registry-install comfyui-lumaai-api` to install the node.

## Nodes

Most of the nodes allow you to save locally the output video. If you keep the default `filename` (empty string), the video will be saved in the `outputs` folder using the `generation_id` as the name.

For images, the node will always save the image locally, but you can set the `filename` to save it with a custom name.

### LumaAIClient

This node is used to create a LumaAI client.

### Ray2Text2Video

This node is used to generate a video from a text prompt with the latest and most powerful model, Ray2.

### LumaText2Video

This node is used to generate a video from a text prompt.

### LumaImage2Video

This node is used to generate a video from an image. The image can be used as the first or last frame.

### LumaInterpolateGenerations

This node is used to interpolate between two generations.

### LumaExtendGeneration

This node is used to extend a generation. You can choose to extend before or after the generation.

### LumaPreviewVideo

This node is used to preview a video. The video is resized to 768px to look better on ComfyUI.

### ImgBBUpload

This node is used to upload an image to ImgBB and return the URL. We need this because Luma API currently only supports image urls as input.
To use this node, you need to have an ImgBB API key. Create an account and get one [here](https://api.imgbb.com/).

### Reference

This node is used to create a reference from an image URL. It is used for style and image references.

### ConcatReferences

This node is used to concatenate a list of references.

### CharacterReference

This node is used to create a character reference from a list of image URLs.

### ImageGeneration

This node is used to generate an image from a prompt.

### ModifyImage
